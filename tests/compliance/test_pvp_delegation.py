Test Task 28: Verify naishi_pvp.py queries GameState for turn state

This test verifies that naishi_pvp.py properly:
1. Checks gs.optional_emissary_available after actions
2. Offers optional emissary to player when flag is True
3. Checks gs.must_develop after actions
4. Requires develop from player when flag is True
