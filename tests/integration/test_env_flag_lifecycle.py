"""
Detailed test for Task 26: Verify multi-action turn mechanics

This test specifically checks:
1. That optional_emissary_available flag is set after develop
2. That the agent policy is called when the flag is set
3. That must_develop flag is set after emissary-first
4. That rewards accumulate correctly
